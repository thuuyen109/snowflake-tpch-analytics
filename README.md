# snowflake-tpch-analytics


This project is a hands-on exploration of Snowflake as a **modern cloud data platform**, covering database setup, security, data pipelines transformations, data quality, and Snowpark-based analytics.

The goal is to understand Snowflake **beyond SQL**, from architecture and governance to programmatic data processing.

---

## Project Objectives

* Understand Snowflake architecture beyond basic querying
* Design a layered data platform using **Medallion Architecture**
* Build ingestion, transformation, and analytics pipelines natively in Snowflake
* Apply **data quality**, **security**, and **governance** best practices
* Explore **Snowpark Python** for programmatic data processing

---

## Architecture Overview

**Architecture pattern:** Medallion (Staging → Silver → Gold)

* **Staging layer**: raw ingestion and schema alignment
* **Silver layer**: cleaned, conformed, business-ready data
* **Gold layer**: analytics- and reporting-focused tables

**Approach:**

* ELT using Snowflake compute
* Clear separation between ingestion, transformation, analytics, and governance
* Modular, script-based implementation for reproducibility

Each module includes SQL scripts and/or notebooks used to validate logic and results.

## Snowflake Features Explored

This project covers a wide range of Snowflake platform features:

* Virtual Warehouses & compute–storage separation
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Medallion architecture implementation
* Snowpipe for continuous data ingestion
* Streams for incremental data processing
* Stored Procedures (SQL & Snowpark)
* Snowpark Python API
* User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
* Data masking policies for sensitive data
* Secure data sharing

---

## Testing & Validation

* Each layer is validated using:

    * Row counts and null checks
    * Business rule verification
    * Sample data inspection via notebooks
    * SQL logic is tested incrementally before promotion to downstream layers

---

## Security & Governance Focus

Security and governance are treated as **first-class concerns**, not afterthoughts:

* RBAC applied at database, schema, and object levels
* Column-level masking for sensitive attributes
* Controlled access patterns for analytics and reporting
* Secure data sharing configuration for external consumers


---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Snowflake should be treated as a **data platform**, not only a SQL engine
* Native Snowflake features can replace many external tools when used correctly
* Governance and security must be designed early in the data lifecycle
* Snowpark enables advanced transformations while keeping compute inside Snowflake
* Clear layering and modular design improve maintainability and scalability
